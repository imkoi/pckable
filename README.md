# pckable
This plugin inspired by Unity Addressables, designed to make content management and delivery simpler for developers. This plugin allows developers to use and manage content more efficiently, enabling them to deliver updates without requiring a new version of the application to be uploaded to the stores.

Moreover, thanks to Godot's dynamic language, this plugin will not only allow for content delivery but also enable the deployment of entire features without needing an update for the players. Additionally, using Godot simplifies memory management for content, ensuring that resources are handled efficiently and effectively, reducing the risk of performance issues.

By leveraging the capabilities of Godot, my plugin aims to streamline the development process, enhance content management, and provide a seamless way to deliver updates and new features to players. Stay tuned for more updates and tutorials on how to integrate and utilize this powerful tool in your projects.
